No Agenda is an award-winning podcast hosted by [Adam Curry](http://curry.com/) and [John C. Dvorak](http://www.dvorak.org/blog/) and takes place twice a week on Thursday and Sunday mornings. The show is a conversation on recent news and media memes.

The show has no advertisers, instead relying on its listeners to voluntarily donate in either lump sums or a recurring plan (referred to by the hosts as the "Value for Value" model). The show also relies on their listeners (known as "Producers") to provide artwork and audio clips.
